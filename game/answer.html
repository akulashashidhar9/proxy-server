                                which is also called the gas giant.

                                Just below the equator of this planet, there is a storm seen for centuries. Scientists
                                observed this storm back in 1800s, which was then thought to be some volcano.

                                Later, after discovery of the improved instruments, it is seen that that was a Storm. It
                                measured more than the whole continent of North America in dimensions.

                                With an average wind speed of 500 km/min. </p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Like all the planets, Mercury moves fastest when it is at its closest
                                point to the Sun, and slowest when it is at its farthest. However, it’s proximity to the
                                Sun means that its average orbital velocity is a speedy 47.362 kilometers a second or
                                29.429 miles per second – approximately 170,500 km/h; 105,945 mph.

                                At this rate, it takes Mercury 87.969 days, or the equivalent of 0.24 Earth years, to
                                complete a single orbit of the Sun. Thus, it can be said that a year on Mercury lasts
                                almost as long as 3 months here on Earth.</p>

                                is a shield volcano 624 km (374 mi) in diameter (approximately the same size as the
                                state of Arizona), 25 km (16 mi) high, and is rimmed by a 6 km (4 mi) high scarp. A
                                caldera 80 km (50 mi) wide is located at the summit of Olympus Mons. To compare, the
                                largest volcano on Earth is Mauna Loa. Mauna Loa is a shield volcano 10 km (6.3 mi) high
                                and 120 km (75 mi) across. The volume of Olympus Mons is about 100 times larger than
                                that of Mauna Loa. In fact, the entire chain of Hawaiian islands (from Kauai to Hawaii)

                                either a neutron star or black hole, because the degeneracy pressure provided by the

                                largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. It has a mean
                                radius of 606 km (377 mi). Charon is the sixth-largest known trans-Neptunian object
                                after Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake and Gonggong.[17] It was discovered in 1978 at the
                                United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., using photographic plates taken at
                                the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).

                                With half the diameter and one eighth the mass of Pluto, Charon is a very large moon in
                                comparison to its parent body. Its gravitational influence is such that the barycenter
                                of the Plutonian system lies outside Pluto. </p>

                                estimates, but there isn’t a firm, solid, 100% answer.. There are different models for
                                estimating the number of stars in the Milky Way and the answers they give differ
                                depending on what is used as the average mass of a star. The most common answer seems to
                                be that there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way on the low-end and 400 billion on
                                the high end. But I’ve seen even higher numbers thrown around. Average falls around 200

                            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">A: CARBON DIOXIDE</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">The atmosphere of Mars is the layer of gases surrounding Mars. It is
                                primarily composed of carbon dioxide (95%), molecular nitrogen (2.8%) and argon (2%). It
                                also contains trace levels of water vapor, oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and noble
                                gases. The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth's. The average surface pressure
                                is only about 610 pascals (0.088 psi) which is less than 1% of the Earth's value. The
                                currently thin Martian atmosphere prohibits the existence of liquid water at the surface
                                of Mars, but many studies suggest that the Martian atmosphere was much thicker in the
                                past. The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to the density found 35 km (22
                                mi) above the Earth's surface and is ~0.020 kg/m3. The atmosphere of Mars has been
                                losing mass to space since the planet formed, and the leakage of gases still continues
                                today.</p>
